          This app is a proof of concept.
      </p>
      <p> The guiding principal seeks to address the shortcomings of traditional streaming services such as Spotify:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fairness: Paying artists fairly per stream. There's a minimum rate to stream a song, but you can also bump it up.</li>
        <li>Transparency: Logging plays on the blockchain. Total play counts are much more difficult to falsify with bots, which will lead to more accurate charting.</li>
        <li>Decentralization: Storing audio files on a decentralized storage network (Crust/IPFS).</li>
      </ul>
    </>
